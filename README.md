# Introduction
- I am currently a junior at the University of Iowa studying business analytics and finance. I am involved in numerous organizations such as the Hawkeye Marching Band, Business Student Ambassador Organization, Tippie Peer Mentors, Tippie International Buddies, and the professional business fraternity, Alpha Kappa Psi. 
# Project Title
- SuSE Linux Software Database Management
# Description
- Over the summer I interned with a software solutions cooperative and one of my main projects was to handle and clean big data. The data that I analyzed was old, inconsistent, and unorganized.
# How to Run Program
- The program I used was an in-house software that my coop used and by using that database along with some royalty reports that were converted on Excel, I was able to roughly estimate the amount of money lost in the sales department due to lack of data maintenance. 
# Files Used
- The files that were used in the project are confidential, of course. Generally, however, there were companies whose software was out-of-date and expired and needed to be updated immediately or else it would become a liability to the integrity of the data. Also, after collaborating with other teams, we found that the security on the old softwares was a security threat and needed to be taken care of.
